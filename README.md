# Résumé Project

This was the second project in the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_. The objective was to edit an existing résumé page by forking from an existing codebase on GitHub, adding our data in specific, valid JSON-formatted objects, and add content to the page with jQuery.

I added additional spice with a new color scheme and some subtle animation.
